#To understand Linux architecture just remember these A(Apps) S(Shell) K(kernel).    To execute a shell script go to the directory where your shell script is saved first then execute with ./file_name.sh

#Shell_scripting always starts with !#/bin/bash and the file extension will be .sh

Shell_Commands I keep forgetting:

free - lists the memory of the machine.
nproc - it will list the number of CPU's running on VM.
top - It will list the processesand many other details of the machine.

df - lists available disk space
df -h: Human readable

#we should give Seth parameter at the beginning of the shell script after shebang(#!/bin/bash)
set -x: 
(-x stands for debug mode)

ps -ef (-ef give all the processess running)
